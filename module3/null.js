/* n JavaScript, null is not a reference to a non-existing object nor a null pointer like in some other languages.
Null
It’s simply a special value which represents nothing, empty or value unknown. */

let age = null

// Null is "false" when converted into a boolean and "0" when a number. It may be assigned a value later.
